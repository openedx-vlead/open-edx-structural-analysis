  <h2>About This Lab</h2>
  <p>	

This laboratory gives the basic understanding of structural member under the action of loads. How structure's behaviour will be changed if there is any redundancy and how suddenly it becomes unstable will be experienced by student. Basics of determinate and indeterminate structures will be introduced through virtual experiment. Plastic behaviour of joints can be understood in virtual experiment which otherwise is very difficult to understand in real experiments.

The main purpose of any structure is to support the loads coming on it by properly transferring them to the foundation. The computation of internal and external forces and displacements produced by the application of loads to make the structure safe. Detailed analysis is to be performed to determine the bending moments, shear force, axial forces etc at the required section. Basic structural analysis contains; linear elastic analysis of structural systems and members like, beam, column, slab, frame, footing etc.

      <h3>Do I need to buy a textbook?</h3>
      <p>No, a free online version of Chemistry: Principles, Patterns, and Applications, First Edition by Bruce Averill and Patricia Eldredge will be available, though you can purchase a printed version (published by FlatWorld Knowledge) if youâ€™d like.</p>
