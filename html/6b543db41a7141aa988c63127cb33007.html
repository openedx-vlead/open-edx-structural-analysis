<p>1.Truss Analysis by Method of joints&nbsp;</p>
<p>If a truss is in equilibrium, then each of its joints must also be in equilibrium.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The method of joints consists of satisfying the equilibrium conditions for the forces exerted on the pin at each joint of the truss.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Truss members are all straight two-force members lying in the same plane.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The force system acting at each pin is coplanar and concurrent (intersecting)&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rotational or moment equilibrium is automatically satisfied at the joint, only need to satisfy&nbsp;</p>
<p>? Fx = 0, ? Fy = 0&nbsp;</p>
<p>Draw the free-body diagram of a joint having at least one known force and at most two unknown forces (may need to first determine external reactions at the truss supports)&nbsp;</p>
<p>Establish the sense of the unknown forces&nbsp;</p>
<p>Always assume the unknown member forces acting on the joints free-body diagram to be in tension (pulling on the pin)&nbsp;</p>
<p>Assume what is believed to be the correct sense of an unknown member force&nbsp;</p>
<p>In both cases a negative value indicates that the sense chosen must be reversed&nbsp;</p>
<p>Orient the x and y axes such that the forces can be easily resolved into their x and y components&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apply ? Fx = 0 and ? Fy = 0 and solve for the unknown member forces and verify their correct sense</p>
