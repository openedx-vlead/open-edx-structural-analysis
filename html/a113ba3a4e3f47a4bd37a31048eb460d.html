<h2>introduction</h2>
<p>Continuous beams, which are beams with more than two supports and covering more than one span, are not statically determinate using the static equilibrium laws</p>
<p>e = strain</p>
<p>&sigma; = stress (N/m2)</p>
<p>E = Young's Modulus = &sigma; /e (N/m2)</p>
<p>y = distance of surface from neutral surface (m).</p>
<p>R = Radius of neutral axis (m).</p>
<p>I = Moment of Inertia (m4 - more normally cm4)</p>
<p>Z = section modulus = I/y max(m3 - more normally cm3)</p>
<p>M = Moment (Nm)</p>
<p>w = Distributed load on beam (kg/m) or (N/m as force units)</p>
<p>W = total load on beam (kg ) or (N as force units)</p>
<p>F= Concentrated force on beam (N)</p>
<p>L = length of beam (m)</p>
<p>x = distance along beam (m)</p>
