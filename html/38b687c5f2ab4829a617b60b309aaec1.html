<h2>Theory</h2>
<p>A retaining wall is a structure which holds back material on one side. These are particularly useful where there is a change in level within a restricted area and insufficient space for banks of appropriate slope. They can also be used to good effect where ground conditions are such that a sloping bank would slump or fail or where there is an awkward junction between adjacent freestanding walls.</p>
